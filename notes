Change in approach.
Make use of the backwardsFacingStep mesh, and modify parts around it.
The scale of the channel happened to be similar to that of the orifice 
channel model we've been using, making this a suitable alterative.

The problem is how we would process values that accumulate on along walls.

2/13
The blockMeshDict file for the orifice channel was completed, and calculated without issue.
While the x-axis grading was set by referencing the original mesh, there is no y-axis grading.
The correct y-axis grading will be implemented once the calculations are complete.

So, at this point, we have:
1. An SST k-omega fluid dynamics simulation
2. ...Housed in a replica of the orifice channel mesh data

The next step will to design the plasma reaction solver, then to create the case files.
